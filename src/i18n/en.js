        p1: "At its core, Acronym Lab is a creative cluster — a group of friends and collaborators from the worlds of film and media. We know what we’re doing, because we’ve been doing it for a long time — evolving within our craft and alongside each other. We understand one another, and we know our strengths (and our weaknesses).",
        p2: "From the very beginning, we realized how powerful the connection is between sound and visuals — especially in motion, especially in advertising. These are areas where traditional logic — of story, image, music, or sound — often breaks down. That’s why it’s critical for both of our core elements to work in sync, at full force, leaving the viewer engaged and not confused.",
